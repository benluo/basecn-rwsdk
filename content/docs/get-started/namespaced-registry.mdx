## What is a Namespaced Registry?

With the release of Shadcn CLI 3.0, you can now install components from basecn using the `@basecn/component-name` format. This simplifies the installation process by eliminating the need to use the `https://basecn.dev/r/component-name.json` format.

## How to Use a Namespaced Registry

To configure the basecn registry in your `components.json`, add the following:

```json title="components.json"
{
  // [!code highlight:3]
  "registries": {
    "@basecn": "https://basecn.dev/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Once configured, you can install components from basecn using the `@basecn/component-name` format.

For example, to install the `button` component, use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @basecn/button
```

This command will install the `button` component from the Basecn registry.
